## Getting Started

### 1. Installation
1.  Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
    **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).<br>
    **Windows users:** You may follow this [guide](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationWindows.html) to download Java `17`.

2.  Download the latest `.jar` file from our GitHub page.

3.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the *home folder* for your ProjectBook.

4.  Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar projectBook.jar` command to run the application.<br>
    A GUI similar to the below (but without any projects) should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.

    ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

### 2. Your First Commands (A Quick Tutorial)

1.  Type commands into the command box and press Enter to execute them. For example, typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.

2.  The app starts with sample data. Let's clear it by typing **`clear`** and pressing Enter.

3.  Now, let's add your first volunteer. Type:
    `addv n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com`

4.  Next, create a project for John to be a part of. Type:
    `project add project/Beach Cleanup d/Weekly cleanup at Siloso Beach`

5.  You should see John as Item 1 in the person list. Let's assign him to your new project. Type:
    `project assign 1 project/Beach Cleanup`

6.  To see a summary of the project and who's in it, type:
    `project view project/Beach Cleanup`

7.  To see all contacts in your book, type `list`.

8.  To see all projects, type `project list`.

9.  To exit the app, type `exit`.

If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

</box>

Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `addv n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `addv n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets `[]` are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [p/PHONE]` can be used as `n/John Doe p/98613698` or as `n/John Doe`.

* `INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the currently displayed list. The index must be a positive integer (1, 2, 3, ...).

* Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[u/UPDATE]…` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `u/add to group chat`, `u/register in portal` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE`, `p/PHONE n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

</box>

<box type="tip" seamless>

 **Pro Tip: Command Chaining**

 The `INDEX` for commands like `edit` or `delete` refers to the *currently displayed list*.

 This means you can "chain" commands. For example:
 1.  Use `find Alex` to show only people whose names contain 'Alex'.
 2.  The list might show two people: `1. Alex Yeoh` and `2. Alexandra Tan`.
 3.  You can then use `delete 1` to delete **Alex Yeoh**, who is the 1st person *in that filtered list*.

</box>

### `help`: Viewing help

Shows a message explaining how to access the help page. The link will bring you to a condensed cheatsheet of commands for your future reference!

**Format:** `help`

![help message](images/helpMessage.png)

---
### `addv` / `addt` / `addo`: Adding a Person (Volunteer, TeamMember, OrganisationMember)

Adds a person of a specific role to the project book. There are 3 roles a person can play: volunteer, committee member, and organisation contact.

<box type="info" seamless>

**What are the 3 types of roles**
* A volunteer is not part of the core team, but is recruited to help with projects. Loopin stores only basic contact information of volunteers.
* A team member is part of the core team and belongs to a committee. Loopin stores the committee and basic contact information of team members.
* An organisation member is someone associated with an external organisation. Loopin stores the organisation and basic contact information of organisation members.

**What is "basic contact information"?**
* A person's name and email are both basic contact information that are required to add a person.
* Additional contact information such as phone number and telegram username can also be stored, but they are not required.

**What is a duplicate person?**
* When adding people into the project book, you might get an error stating that the person is already in the project book.
* A person with the exact same **phone** number, **email** address or **telegram** username will be considered a duplicate person and cannot be added.
* This is because two different people cannot have the same phone number, email address or telegram username.
* People with the same name are not considered duplicate because it is possible for people to have the same name (even the same full name).

</box>

## FAQ

**Q**: **How do I transfer my data to another Computer?** <br>
**Step 1:** Install the app on the other computer <br>
**Step 2:** Make a new folder in the same folder as the app, and name it data<br>
**Step 3:** Copy the original projectbook.json located in the data folder over to the new data folder <br>
**Step 4:** You are ready to use the project book like before!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1.  **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2.  **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
3.  **When entering extremely long inputs** such as names, phone numbers, emails and remarks, the UI truncates them with a `...`. We plan to fix this in future enhancements by wrapping the text onto the next line. For now, to avoid this, please avoid typing in overly long inputs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Coming in Future Versions

1. `undo` feature <br>
   Are you worried that you might accidentally delete something you shouldn't have? <br>
   With the upcoming `undo` feature, you can easily undo any unwanted changes!

2. `archive` and `load` feature <br>
   Are you starting on a fresh new set of projects, but don't want to delete your old ones? <br>
   Using the upcoming `archive` feature, you can simply archive your old project book and start on a new one! Load the archived data whenever you want using the `load` command!

3. `project edit` feature <br>
   Want to update a project name or description? <br>
   Edit a project with the upcoming `project edit` feature!

4. Shortened project commands <br>
   Are you tired of typing out `project add`, `project delete` and all these other long project command words? <br>
   Use the upcoming shortened project commands! `project add` can be shortened to `addp`, `project delete` can be shortened to `deletep` and so on! <br>
   Don't worry if you've gotten used to the old format — they'll still be accepted.
