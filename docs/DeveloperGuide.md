## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-W14-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/loopin/projectbook/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-W14-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/loopin/projectbook/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-W14-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/loopin/projectbook/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `SplitPane`, `PersonListPanel`, `ProjectListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-W14-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/loopin/projectbook/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-W14-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-W14-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/loopin/projectbook/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `ProjectBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `ProjectBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `ProjectBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-W14-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/loopin/projectbook/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The **`Model`** component:

* stores all data of the application, i.e.,
    - `Person` objects (contained in a `UniquePersonList`), and
    - `Project` objects (contained in a `UniqueProjectList`).  
      These lists are contained within the `ProjectBook`.

* keeps track of the currently _selected_ or _filtered_ lists of both `Person` and `Project` objects.  
  These are exposed to other components as unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` and `ObservableList<Project>` objects, allowing the UI to automatically update when data changes.

* stores a `UserPrefs` object that represents user preferences (e.g., GUI settings, file paths).  
  These preferences are exposed externally as `ReadOnlyUserPrefs` to ensure immutability.

* ensures data integrity by preventing duplicate entries through `UniquePersonList` and `UniqueProjectList`.

* defines relationships between people and projects:
    - Each `Person` may be linked to multiple `Project` objects.
    - Each `Project` contains one or more `Membership` entries that connect it back to the people involved.

* distinguishes between different types of persons:
    - `Volunteer`: a volunteer with basic contact info and tags.
    - `TeamMember`: a team member belonging to a committee.
    - `OrgMember`: a person associated with an external organisation.

* does not depend on other major components (e.g., Logic, UI, or Storage).  
  This separation ensures that the `Model` represents the core domain data and logic, independent of how the application interacts with users or files.

[//]: # (<box type="info" seamless>)

[//]: # (**Note:** An alternative &#40;arguably, a more OOP&#41; model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `Project
Book`, which `Person` references. This allows `Project
Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-W14-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/loopin/projectbook/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both project book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `ProjectBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.project.commons` package.

## **Implementation of future features**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are intended to be implemented in the future.

### \[To be implemented in future versions\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedProjectBook`. It extends `ProjectBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `projectBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedProjectBook#commit()` — Saves the current project book state in its history.
* `VersionedProjectBook#undo()` — Restores the previous project book state from its history.
* `VersionedProjectBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone project book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitProjectBook()`, `Model#undoProjectBook()` and `Model#redoProjectBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedProjectBook` will be initialized with the initial project book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single project book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the project book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitProjectBook()`, causing the modified state of the project book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `projectBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted project book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitProjectBook()`, causing another modified project book state to be saved into the `projectBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitProjectBook()`, so the project book state will not be saved into the `projectBookStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoProjectBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous project book state, and restores the project book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial ProjectBook state, then there are no previous Project
Book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoProjectBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoProjectBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the project book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `projectBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest project book state, then there are no undone ProjectBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoProjectBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the project book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitProjectBook()`, `Model#undoProjectBook()` or `Model#redoProjectBook()`. Thus, the `projectBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitProjectBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `projectBookStateList`, all project book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire project book.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Instructions for manual testing**

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</box>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

    1. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder

    2. Double-click the jar file Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum.

1. Saving window preferences

    1. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

    2. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

### Adding a person

1. Adding a person while all persons are shown

    1. Test case: `addv n/John Wang e/johnwang@gmail.com t/johnwang`<br>
       Expected: A new Volunteer named John Wang with email johnwang@gmail.com and telegram @johnwang is added to the person list.

    2. Test case: `addo o/Good Org n/Mr Good e/goodorg@org.com`<br>
       Expected: A new representative Mr Good from Good Org has been added to the person list.

### Adding a project

1. Adding a project while all projects are being shown

    1. Test case: `project add n/Clean Beach d/Cleaning the beach`<br>
       Expected: A new project named Clean Beach is added to the list with the correct timestamp. No last update is available.

    2. Test case: `project add d/No name provided`<br>
       Expected: No project is added. Error message shown indicating that the name field is required. Status bar remains unchanged.

### Adding a remark to person

1. Adding a remark when person is being shown

    1. Test case: `remark 1 u/Call him`<br>
       Expected: A new remark tag labeled "Call him" is attached to the first person in the person list.

    2. Test case: `remark 999 u/Call him`<br>
       Expected: No remarks are added as index does not exist.

### Assigning a person to project

1. Assigning a person to project

    1. Prerequisites: At least one project (e.g. Clean Beach) exists and one person exists.

    1. Test case: `project assign 1 project/Clean Beach`<br>
       Expected: The first person in the persons list is added to the project Clean Beach, with the correct updated status bar

    2. Test case: `project assign 1 project/Clean Beach`<br>
       Expected: An error message appears indicating that person is already in the project.

### Deleting a person

1. Deleting a person while all persons are being shown

    1. Prerequisites: List all persons using the `list` command. Multiple persons in the list.

    2. Test case: `delete 1`<br>
       Expected: First contact is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted contact shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.

    3. Test case: `delete 0`<br>
       Expected: No person is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.

    4. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x`, `...` (where x is larger than the list size)<br>
       Expected: Similar to previous.

### Saving data

1. Dealing with missing data files

    1. To simulate a missing data file, delete the file data/projectbook.json.

    2. Launch the app.
       Expected: The app will be populated with sample data, similar to first launch.

2. Dealing with corrupted data files
    
    1. To simulate a corrupted data file, edit the file data/projectbook.json such that the data is invalid.

    2. Launch the app.
       Expected: The app will delete all data and start from an empty projectbook.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**
Team size: 5

1. Handle long inputs in the UI (names, phones, emails, remarks).<br>
Currently, long inputs are truncated with "..." in the UI. We plan to implement text wrapping so that the full text is displayed to the user.

2. Allow non exact matches for project/PROJECT_NAME inputs.<br>
Currently, commands that require the input project/PROJECT_NAME require the user input to match the project name exactly. We plan to allow the user to use a substring of project name instead of the full project name, provided that there is only one project that matches the substring.

3. Make `find` search more fields.<br>
Currently, `find` only searches the name and `findrole` only searches the role. We plan to make `find` more flexible and allow it to search other fields such as the phone, email and telegram.

4. Allow user to choose between long and short version of each project command word.<br>
Currently, each project command follows the format `project COMMAND_WORD`. We plan to implement a second, shorter version of each command word (i.e. project add = addp, project delete = deletep, project assign = assignp)

5. Allow more flexibility in the validation for Phone.<br>
Currently, phone numbers must be strictly numeric and more than 3 digits. We plan to allow for more flexible formats such as `1234 5678 (HP) 1111-3333 (Office)` and `(+65) 9876 4321`

6. Add deadline for remarks.<br>
Currently, remarks act as a simple reminder without any prioritised order. We plan to give the user the option to add a deadline for when a remark should be resolved by, and prioritize the order of remarks by the urgency of the deadline.

7. Add warnings for `clear`, `delete` and `project delete`<br>
Currently, if the user correctly inputs the command for `clear`, `delete`, and `project delete`, the app will simply perform the deletion without any additional checks. We plan to add an additional warning step, where the app will warn the user of the exact deletion that is about to happen and asks the user for confirmation before deleting.

8. Add `project edit` commands.
Currently, projects cannot be edited once created. We plan to include this command to provide greater flexibility in managing project information.
